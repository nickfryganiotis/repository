  "Peer to peer learning":
    "Peer to peer learning is a type of mutual learning and training strategy. It involves participants of the same level engaging in collaborative education.​",
  "Gamification​":
    "Gamification in learning involves using game-based elements such as point scoring, peer competition, team work, score tables to drive engagement, help students assimilate new information and test their knowledge.​",
  "Role playing​":
    "Role play is a form of experiential learning (Russell & Shepherd, 2010). Students take on assigned roles and act out those roles through a scripted play. The role play can be carried out one-to-one (individual role play) or as a group role play with each member in the group taking on a role/character.​",
  "Project based learning":
    "Project-based learning (PBL) or project-based instruction is an instructional approach designed to give students the opportunity to develop knowledge and skills through engaging projects set around challenges and problems they may face in the real world.​",
  "Collaborative learning​":
    "Collaborative learning is an umbrella term for a variety of educational approaches involving joint intellectual effort by students, or students and teachers together. Usually, students are working in groups of two or more, mutually searching for understanding, solutions, or meanings, or creating a product.​",
  "Case study learning​":
    "Case studies is an instructional method that refers to assigned scenarios based on situations in which students observe, analyze, record, implement, conclude, summarize, or recommend. Case studies are created and used as a tool for analysis and discussion.​",
  "Problem-based learning (PBL)":
    "Problem-based learning (PBL) is a teaching style that pushes students to become the drivers of their learning education. Problem-based learning uses complex, real-world issues as the classroom's subject matter, encouraging students to develop problem-solving skills and learn concepts instead of just absorbing facts.",
  "Remind (Relaxation, respiration, Meditation, Mindfulness)​":
    "A new study suggests that mindfulness education — lessons on techniques to calm the mind and body — can reduce the negative effects of stress and increase students' ability to stay engaged, helping them stay on track academically and avoid behavior problems.​",
  "OST (Out of School Time)​":
    "Out of School Time (OST) is a supervised program that young people regularly attend when school is not in session. This can include before- and after- school programs on a school campus or facilities such as academic programs (e.g., reading or math focused programs), specialty programs (e.g., sports teams, STEM, arts enrichment), and multipurpose programs that provide an array of activities.​",
  "Cross Curricular learning​":
    "Cross-curricular instruction is an instructional strategy that offers a way for teachers to plan lessons that incorporate more than one disciplinary area. This allows students to broaden their lens of understanding and apply skills and strategies they learn in lessons to deepen their overall understanding and make authentic, real-world connections.​\n Cross-curricular instruction also allows students the opportunity to learn skills in different contexts. For example, if a student has a passion for science, they may be more engaged and willing to take risks by applying concepts they have learned in math. If a student is apprehensive about writing, but passionate about history, incorporating writing into social studies lessons allows them to have a positive mindset and increases their engagement with the skill they are practicing.​\n Cross-curricular instruction also lends itself to project-based learning. This authentic learning experience and strategy allows students to further put into practice the skills they have learned in their studies. Students are able to make meaningful connections to each curricular area, but also see the learning experience as a whole.​",
  "Arts-based learning":
    "Arts-based learning is the instrumental use of artistic skills, processes and experiences as educational tools to foster learning in non-artistic disciplines and domains.​",
  "Comprehensive model 24/7​": `The objective is to provide 'authentic learning', i.e. "a wide variety of educational techniques that enable students to relate to, and probably solve real life problems", as defined in the Glossary of Education Reform (Great Schools Partnership, 2013).​`,
